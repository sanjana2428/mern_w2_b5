    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-3"><sup>[a]</sup></a> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content">web content</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets </a>(CSS) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a> or from local storage and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine">render</a> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page semantically</a> and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Images_and_objects">images</a> and other objects such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Forms">interactive forms</a> may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document">structured documents</a> by denoting structural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a>, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as &lt;<strong style="color:green;">img</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">input</strong>&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;<strong style="color:green;">p</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">/p</strong>&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Browsers</a> do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting language</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium </a>(W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-deprecated-4">[3]</a> A form of HTML, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.</p>

    <p>In 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist">physicist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-7"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_system">data systems</a> engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is the first entry.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-6"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
    <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-7"><sup>[6]</sup></a> first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-tagshtml-8"><sup>[7]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-9"><sup>[8]</sup></a> It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN_SGML">CERN SGML</a>, an in-house <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard Generalized Markup Language</a> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-10"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
    <p>HTML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a> use to interpret and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting">compose</a> text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a> developed in the early 1960s for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
    <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>(IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an SGML <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document type definition</a> to define the syntax.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-11"><sup>[10]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-12"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA Mosaic</a> browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-html+-13"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
    <p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-14"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
    <p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-raggett-15"><sup>[14]</sup></a> In 2000, HTML became an international standard (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission">IEC </a>15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-16"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-w3c2014-52"><sup>[51]</sup></a> In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML".

    <p><ul>In July 2012, WHATWG and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a> decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-54"><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>
    <p>In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-55"><sup>[54]</sup></a> The criterion for advancement to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_recommendation#W3C_recommendation_(REC)">W3C Recommendation</a> is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-W3Crec-56"><sup>[55]</sup></a></ul></p>

    <p><ul>In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-57"><sup>[56]</sup></a></ul></p>
    <p><ul>On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-58"><sup>[57]</sup></a> meaning the specification process is complete.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-finalars-59"><sup>[58]</sup></a></ul></p>

    <p><ul><i>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a></i></ul></p>
    <p>XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> 1.0. It is now referred to as the XML syntax for HTML and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-60"><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-61"><sup>[60]</sup></a> and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.</li>
        <li>XHTML 1.1<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-62"><sup>[61]</sup></a> was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-63"><sup>[62]</sup></a></li>
        <li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft. Work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML#XHTML5">XHTML5</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-64"><sup>[63]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-65"><sup>[64]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-66"><sup>[65]</sup></a> XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>

    <h3>Markup</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;<strong style="color:green;">h1</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">/h1</strong>&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;<strong style="color:green;">img</strong>&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
    <p>Another important component is the HTML <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration">document type declaration</a>, which triggers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_mode">standards mode</a> rendering.</p>
    <p>The following is an example of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">"Hello, World!" program:</a></p>
    <style>
        pre {
            background-color: #f6f6f6; /* light grey background */
            border: 1px solid #ccc;    /* border around box */
            padding: 10px;             /* space inside box */
            font-family: monospace;    /* code-like font */
            white-space: pre-wrap;     /* wraps long lines */
        }
    </style>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
    <p>The text between &lt;<strong style="color:green;">html</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">/html</strong>&gt; describes the web page, and the text between &lt;<strong style="color:green;">body</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">/body</strong>&gt; is the visible page content. The markup text &lt;<strong style="color:green;">title</strong>&gt;This is a title&lt;<strong style="color:green;">/title</strong>&gt; defines the browser page title shown on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_tab">browser tabs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)">window</a> titles and the tag &lt;<strong style="color:green;">div</strong>&gt; defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between &lt;<strong style="color:green;">head</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">/head</strong>&gt;, a &lt;<strong style="color:green;">meta</strong>&gt; element can be used to define webpage metadata.</p>
    <p>The Document Type Declaration &lt;<strong style="color:brown;">!DOCTYPE html</strong>&gt; is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode">quirks mode</a>" for rendering.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-hsivonen-73"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>
    <h3>Elements</h3>
    <p><i>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML element</a></i></p>
     <table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <td align="center">
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/HTML_element_content_categories.svg/500px-HTML_element_content_categories.svg.png" align="right" width="230" height="230">
                <p>HTML element content categories</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a>. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#cite_note-74"><sup>[73]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS"><sup>[better source needed]</sup></sup></a></p>
    <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;<strong style="color:green;">p</strong>&gt; and "end tag" &lt;<strong style="color:green;">/p</strong>&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
    <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
    <p>The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the &lt;<strong style="color:green;">img</strong>&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: &lt;<strong style="color:green;">img</strong> src="example.com/example.jpg"&gt;</p>
    <p>Some elements, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_breaking_character">line break</a>&lt;<strong style="color:green;">br</strong>&gt; do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
    <p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element <p>, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML authors.</p>
    <p>The general form of an HTML element is therefore: <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">''content''</tag>. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the <br> tag or the inline <img> tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. The end tag's name is preceded by a slash character /. If a tag has no content, an end tag is not allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.</p>
    <h4>Element examples</h4>   
    <p><i>See also: HTML element</i></p>
    <p>Header of the HTML document: <head>...</head>. The title is included in the head, for example:</p>
    <style>
        pre {
            background-color: #f6f6f6; /* light grey background */
            border: 1px solid #ccc;    /* border around box */
            padding: 10px;             /* space inside box */
            font-family: monospace;    /* code-like font */
            white-space: pre-wrap;     /* wraps long lines */
        }
    </style>
<pre>
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="stylebyjimbowales.css"&gt; &lt;!--Imports Stylesheets--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
    <h4>Headings</h4>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:</p>
    
    <p>The effects are:</p>
    <ul>
    <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
    </ul>
    <p>CSS can substantially change the rendering.</p>
    <p>Paragraphs:</p>

    <h5>Line breaks</h5>
    <p><br>. The difference between <br> and <p> is that <br> breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas <p> sections the page into paragraphs. The element <br> is an empty element in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it must not have an end tag.</p>

    <h5>Links</h5>
    <p>This is a link in HTML. To create a link the <a> tag is used. The href attribute holds the URL address of the link.</p>
    
    <h5>Inputs</h5>
    <p>There are many possible ways a user can give inputs like:</p>

    <h5>Comments:</h5>

    <p>Comments can help in the understanding of the markup and do not display in the webpage.</p>
    <p>There are several types of markup elements used in HTML:</p>
    <strong>Structural markup indicates the purpose of text</strong>
    <ul>
        <p>For example, <h2>Golf</h2> establishes "Golf" as a second-level heading. Structural markup does not denote any specific rendering, but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting. Content may be further styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).[74]</p>
    </ul>
    <strong>Presentational markup indicates the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose</strong>
    <ul>
        <p>For example, <b>bold text</b> indicates that visual output devices should render "boldface" in bold text, but gives a little indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that read the text aloud) should do. In the case of both <b>bold text</b> and <i>italic text</i>, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that are more semantic in nature, such as <strong>strong text</strong> and <em>emphasized text</em> respectively. It is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements. However, they are not equivalent to their presentational counterparts: it would be undesirable for a screen reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance, but on a screen, such a name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under the HTML 4.0 specification in favor of using CSS for styling.</p>
    </ul>
    <strong>Hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents</strong>
    <ul>
        <p>An anchor element creates a hyperlink in the document and its href attribute sets the link's target URL. For example, the HTML markup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, will render the word "Wikipedia" as a hyperlink. To render an image as a hyperlink, an img element is inserted as content into the a element. Like br, img is an empty element with attributes but no content or closing tag. <a href="https://example.org"><img src="image.gif" alt="descriptive text" width="50" height="50" border="0"></a>.</p>
    </ul>
    <h5>Attributes</h5>
    <p><i>Main article: HTML attribute</i></p>
    <p>Most of the attributes of an element are name–value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML).[75][76] Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[77] In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[7] like the ismap attribute for the img element.[78]</p>
    <p>There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :</p>
    <li>
        <p>The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID "Attributes" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes.</p>
        <p>The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation <class="notation"> to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in microformats. Multiple class values may be specified; for example <class="notation important"> puts the element into both the notation and the important classes.</p>
        <p>An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.</p>
        <p>The title attribute is used to attach a subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.</p>
        <p>The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language document:</p>
    </li>
    <p>The abbreviation element, abbr, can be used to demonstrate some of these attributes:</p>
    <p>This example displays as HTML; in most browsers, pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the title text "Hypertext Markup Language."</p>
    <p>Most elements take the language-related attribute dir to specify text direction, such as with "rtl" for right-to-left text in, for example, Arabic, Persian or Hebrew.[79]</p>
    <h4>Character and entity references</h4>
    <ul>
    <p>See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">List of XML and HTML character entity references</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_and_HTML">Unicode and HTML</a></p></ul>
    <p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>
    <p>The ability to "escape" characters in this way allows for the characters < and & (when written as &lt; and &amp;, respectively) to be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example, a literal < normally indicates the start of a tag, and & normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference; writing it as &amp; or &#x26; or &#38; allows & to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The double-quote character ("), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &quot; or &#x22; or &#34; when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently, the single-quote character ('), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &#x27; or &#39; (or as &apos; in HTML5 or XHTML documents[80][81]) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook the need to escape such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup, which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other user agents that may try to parse the document for search and indexing purposes for example.</p>
    <p>Escaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed, or that are not available in the document's character encoding, to be represented within the element and attribute content. For example, the acute-accented e (é), a character typically found only on Western European and South American keyboards, can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference &eacute; or as the numeric references &#xE9; or &#233;, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings. Unicode character encodings such as UTF-8 are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the characters of the world's writing systems.[82]</p>
